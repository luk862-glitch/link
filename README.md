# My Link Project: Dinner Party

An interactive web experience built using the Are.na API.
This project presents a curated collection of images, videos, audio, texts, and links around the theme of food and gathering, styled as plated content arranged on a dining table.

**Concept**
The project begins with the idea that digital content is consumable, much like food. I reimagined the Are.na channel as a dinner table where each block is presented as a plated course, emphasizing the act of serving and sharing content. The visual arrangement draws inspiration from Le Petit Chef, a dining experience known for projecting animation onto plates before each course is served.

**Tech used** 
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Are.na API
